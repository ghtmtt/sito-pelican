If you are looking for simple or advanced maps creation, you are in the right place.

I have years of experience as a cartographer and I am also a developer of QGIS software (click [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits?author=ghtmtt) to see my personal contribution to the software).

QGIS allows to maintain complex project with tons of layers; moreover a very complete suite of tool offers the right ways to manage and transform the layers and a huge variety of styling options are available to create maps for every purpose.

With additional plugins it is even simpler to create *time maps* and 3D maps.
