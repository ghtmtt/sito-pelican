My name is Matteo Ghetta and I'm an environmental scientist graduated in **Analisys and Environmental Management** at the University of Bologna with a specialization in geochemistry, hydrology with a particular focus in **Geographical Informative Systems (GIS)**.

At the present I'm a researcher of the **Scuola di Perfezionamento Sant'Anna of Pisa** and I'm working as core developer of the [**FREEWAT project**](http://www.freewat.eu/). Within the project I'm writing python code for the developing of a complex hydrological analysis plugin for QGIS.

Since many years I work with **Open Source Software** in a Linux environment and gain many experience in this sector. In particular I'm specialized in the Geographical Open Source Software (**GFOSS**), especially [**QGIS**](http://qgis.org/), but also [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), [SAGA](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html) and spatial database as [SpatiaLite](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/) and [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/).


Beside GIS I deal also with data analysis always preferring Open Source Software like [R statistical analysis](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/).

Further than just using Open Source Software, when possible I contribute to the projects in different many ways:

* code writing for new features or bug solving
* adding parts to the user manuals and tutorials
* translating manuals, graphical interfaces and websites
