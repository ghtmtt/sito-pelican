The use of complex and complete software like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with the graphical interface [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the object oriented programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/) data analysis is easy to perform.

### R and RStudio
R and RStudio allow to manage large datasets and create complex data projects. Combining the core power of these tools with additional libraries like *ggplot2* and *plotly* for graphics, *dplyr* and *reshape2* for shaping the datasets and many many others, data analysis for all kind is just a step away!

## Python
Python is without a doubt the most common programming language in the world.

Writing and understanding code in python is very easy, but at the same time, python is very robust, reliable, fast and adaptable for all uses.

In addition to R that is *just* a statistical language, with python is possible to write entire and complete **standalone software**, like external plugins for existing software (e.g. QGIS plugins) or complex scripts that run by themselves.

If python alone cannot satisfy the needs, there are thousands of additional packages outside that are just waiting to be used: *matplotlib* and *plotly* for plots, *scipy* and *numpy* for complex statistical analysis and many many others.
